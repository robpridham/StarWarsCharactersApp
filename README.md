# Star Wars Characters App

This is a demonstration app in response to the 'SWAPI' brief.

It's written entirely in Kotlin and built using Android Studio 3.3 Beta 4, due to problematic resource dependency resolution in 3.2.1.

It attempts to demonstrate some key architectural principles such as:

* Kotlin idioms
* separation for testability
* single responsibility, dependency injection etc.
* fragment-oriented design incorporating viewmodel, controller and view wrapper 
* fragment lifecycle and inter-fragment transitions
* RecyclerView and adapter
* typical JSON & REST API interaction

as well as basic Android design fundamentals.

There's some limited unit tests powered by Mockito.
